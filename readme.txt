an exploration in writing a stack-based (concatenative) programming language
2013 Ed Paradis

unfortuntately, this language doesn't have a name yet.

It is rather Forth-like in its syntax, but I'd think most concatenative languages would be.

Goals:
- write a useful implemenation in Python
- port to other programming languages as an excercise
- write a version suitable for running on an Arduino
